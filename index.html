            <p class="emphasis-text" data-highlight="true">Canada is adrift. Productivity is stagnant. Talent is fleeing. Housing costs are exploding. Living standards are declining. Tariffs loom.</p>
            <p>Other nations are taking risks while we sit and wait. We cannot solve this crisis with yesterday's thinking. Canada needs to break out of the status quo and embrace bold ideas.</p>

            <h2>Blueprints for a Bolder Canada</h2>
            <p>No more white papers and committees. We are working with our country's builders to create detailed policy memos that will:</p>
            <ul class="policy-list">
                <li>Make Canada the go-to energy superpower</li>
                <li>Build more homes faster than ever before</li>
                <li>Create high-grade infrastructure to get people moving</li>
                <li>Revamp healthcare from the ground up</li>
                <li>Develop a government that attracts top talent and delivers result</li>
                <li>Supercharge competition and innovation</li>
                <li>Let Canadians keep more of their paycheque</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="emphasis-text">Think tanks write reports. We are writing a new story for our country.</p>
            <p>We're builders, not bureaucrats: Entrepreneurs who have scaled global companies working with policy veterans who have shipped change and government leaders who have delivered results.</p>

            <h2>Our Approach: Non-Partisan and Actionable</h2>
            <p>We are not interested in political points or making backroom deals. Our only aim is Canadian prosperity. Every idea is open to any leader with the courage to pick it up.</p>
            <p class="emphasis-text larger">Every Monday we will release one radical reform memo, backed by entrepreneurs who've built big things.</p>
            <p>We have heard the excuses: "It's impossible", "that's not how we do things", "we need more studies." We're done with excuses. These ideas have the ability to transform our country and they are ready to be put into action.</p>
